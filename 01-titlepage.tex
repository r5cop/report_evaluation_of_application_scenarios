%%Abstract &
%%This deliverable adresses Task 35.1 (Soft-error-prone components analysis) and
%%Task 35.2 (Hardware and hardware/software profiling).  It contains a survey of the
%%capabilities of making forecasts of probable soft-error-prone components in system
%%on chips based on SystemC high-level system descriptions. State-of-the-art
%%methodologies on soft-error analysis techniques are investigated and suitable
%%methodologies and techniques are proposed for their use in SystemC simulations.
%%With regard to the hardware and hardware/software profiling different hardware and
%%software implementations of different video algorithms were benchmarked against
%%each other.
